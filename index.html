					Hello, world! My name is Viktor Holta—also known as Parslie—and I'm a software engineering student. 
					These pages will serve as a collection and portfolio of all my works and experiences.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Programming</h3>
				<p>
					I've been interested in the world of programming since elementary school and have since then used a variety of different languages. Today the languages I'm most comfortable with are 
					<strong>Python, C++, C#, and Java.</strong>
					The software I use to program in include
					<strong>Android Studio, Eclipse, VIM, and Visual Studio.</strong>
					As of now I have used my knowledge in programming to create 
					<strong>video games and utility software.</strong>
				</p>
				
				<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
				<p>
					Other than prgramming, I'm also interested graphic designing. I mainly work with 
					<strong>pixel art, UI, and photo-manipulation.</strong>
					The software I use to work with these include 
					<strong>Photoshop and Aseprite.</strong>
					<!--Up until now I have used-->
